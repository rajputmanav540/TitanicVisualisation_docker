## **ðŸ”¹ Docker Architecture Diagram**

Below is a visual representation of the Docker architecture:

![Docker Architecture](images/home_page.png)

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the key components mentioned above. The **Docker Daemon** runs on the host machine and manages the creation and execution of containers. Users interact with Docker through the **CLI**, while the images and containers reside in the system's filesystem. The **Docker registry** holds the images, making it easier for users to pull and push images from a centralized location.
